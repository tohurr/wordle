# Wordle Clone

I will be building a game called Wordle. Here is the link to the official game site, https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html. 

The game is very simple. The user gets 6 tries to guess a 5 letter word that is pre-defined. The game requires the user to click a keyboard and submit their choice, it changes color to show if they guessed any correct letters and if that letter is in the correct place. The game continues until the user guesses the right word or runs out of turns.

The only correct word for this game is "REACT".

## This is what my Wordle clone web page looks like

When making this project I got inspiration and help from this youtube video, "Build a Wordle Clone in ReactJS - Best React Project", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDTNwmXUz2c. 

##
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
